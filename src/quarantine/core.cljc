  "Reversible removal, the pure half.

  The idea this library exists to make reusable: **a tool that removes things
  chosen by a heuristic should not have a delete opcode.** It moves them into a
  per-run vault together with a manifest sufficient to put them back exactly,
  and destroying those bytes is a separate, later, explicitly acknowledged
  operation gated on a retention floor.

  This namespace holds the manifest schema, retention arithmetic and receipt
  construction. It performs no IO — `quarantine.host` does that — so the rules
  about what is allowed to be destroyed are testable without a filesystem.

  Extracted from gftdcojp/ai-gftd-misogi, where it was verified by a real
  filesystem round trip asserting mode and mtime survive."
